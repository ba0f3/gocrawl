## 2026-04-02 - Log Injection Prevention
**Vulnerability:** Log injection via unsanitized URL paths.
**Learning:** Middleware functions in Go (standard HTTP or Gin) frequently log request details. If paths containing newlines are logged directly using `log.Printf` without sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary log entries.
**Prevention:** Sanitize inputs (e.g., replace or remove `\n` and `\r`) before writing them to logs.
